Если вы вдруг как и я любите писать скрипты, которые вам упрощают жизнь и ускоряют процесс выполнения задач, то вам это будет полезно. Did your computer fail to open a RMS file? We explain what RMS files are and recommend software that we know can open or convert your RMS files.  I would suggest that you try a universal file viewer like Free File Viewer. It can open over 200 different types of files - and very likely yours. I'll show you instructions. 1. Download font packages you need from https://www.google.com/get/noto/ 2. Connect to your rM using ssh terminal and type commands. The last fc-list command will show you font lists before installing new fonts. - `mkdir ~/noto` - `ln -s ~/noto /usr/share/fonts/opentype/noto` - `fc-list` 3. Unzip font package and upload font files ( otf) to "noto" you just made in your home directory. You can use scp to upload files. The entire path is "/home/root/noto/.
