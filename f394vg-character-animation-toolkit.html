Hi everyone, I've been a long time Rigger and animator for MAX, so currently finding my feet with Maya. So far, there are some things about it I love, clearly Maya was designed with character animation in mind more than MAX was. however one thing in particular has me a little worried. In Max we have CAT (Character Animation Toolkit), which had it's own gimmicky kind of rig creation mode, it worked quite well, but I'm really enjoying HumanIK right now. looking forward to working 3ds max cat, cat animation in 3ds max, character animation in 3ds max, character animation tool kit, walk animation, character walk cycle, cg character anima. 
this face palm is for you. ( So I been trying to improve my rigging skills with 3Ds Max and scraped my biped model in favor of the Character Animation Toolkit (CAT) for the built in kinematics and other niffy stuff that makes doing custom animation easier. Still working out the kinks in the skinning and some bones but I think it's close enough for some animating fun.

Love how he looks and how he moves in this game. He has some great animations and the back1,4,1 combo is just pure joy to land on unsuspecting opponents. But since he was (I'm pretty sure) the first character they've designed for 11, his options aren't many. Only 2 specials? Compared to Jade that's ridiculous. And when you compare him to the likes of Jacqui, Liu, Kung Lao and Jax, he's so bland. Being the Ryu of the series doesn't mean you have to be bland. Wouldn't it be better.

It kinda is. BUT without being such a debbie downer this time, I just wanna discuss the reason I think he isn't really a bad character overall but he is one of the most, if not THE most boring character to play as and fight against.

I seem to be getting a lot of compliments and some requests which are posing challenges. So will address those here. Prior to the launch day of Thememakers Toolkit (TMT) I knew nothing about 3D modelling. I knew I wanted to create the community Disney charachters as so many of you were building Disney inspired parks.

At least in the case of I and II, they aren't talked about much and had a bad reputation, so fresh perspective helped. The character animation toolkit is the main output of the project.

Being more discerning and hesitant about 'Grand Prize' and the new 'Nice' category, so I would highy suggest against counting 'Grand Prize' and 'Nice' and comparing to the 'I'm Sorry' as a judgement on quality of the pool. Also a debut of new format attempt. My format-fu is weak as hell, so be patient if things fuck up.
